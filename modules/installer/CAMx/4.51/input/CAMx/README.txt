What is this directory about?
_____________________________


This directory contains patches / templates for the compilation of CAMx 4.51.
The files have the same relative path as in the bin/4.51/src/CAMx directory,
the installer automatically knows about those files (because they are present).

But really make sure their relative path is OK!
