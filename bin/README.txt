What is this directory about?
_____________________________


This directory contains the CAMx executables.
They MUST be in directories with the version X.YZ as
their name.

When adding a new version, add it to the svn repository by typing
(assuming you are in the "bin" dirctory)

svn add <version>
svn commit -m"added version <version> "

Also contains 3rd party scripts used by the CAMxRunner.
