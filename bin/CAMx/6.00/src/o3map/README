Compile O3MAP using the makefile included with the source code.
Compiler and associated flag variables are supplied for PGF and Intel.

The example job script runs O3MAP in two modes: for daily input TOMS files,
and for a monthly input TOMS file.

*NOTE: The AHOMAP program will only generate the mandatory ozone column
       inputs for CAMx.  It will not generate the optional land-ocean mask
       fields; it is left to the user to generate the optional
       fields and include them appropriately into the ozone column file.

Revsion History
---------------
April 2012:
1. Based on the older AHOMAP program but simplified to be compatible with
   CAMx v6.0.  The file only includes the ozone column data; albedo and
   haze fields are set inside CAMx. Snow cover has been moved to the
   time-variant 2D surface met file.  All optional fields except land-ocean
   mask are no longer supported in CAMx and have been removed.
