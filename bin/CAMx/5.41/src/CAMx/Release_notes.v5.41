Overview of Version 5.41
------------------------

V5.41 includes two chemical updates, some performance-related
modifications, and several bug fixes from the previous release
(v5.40).

There are no changes to I/O file formats from v5.40.


v5.41 Updates
-------------

1. Two new chemical mechanims have been added:
   1) Mech 1: CB6 with iodine chemistry intended for modeling
      ozone in marine environments as presented in 
      http://www.cmascenter.org/conference/2012/slides/yarwood_modeling_ozone_2012.pdf
   2) Mech 2: CB6r1 is revision 1 to CB6.  It revises isoprene
      and aromatics extensively, and has additional NOx recycling
      from organic nitrates.  Not all changes discussed in the
      reference below are implemented at this time pending results
      of current research.
      http://aqrp.ceer.utexas.edu/projectinfo%5C10-042%5C10-042%20Final%20Report.pdf

   Implications: Use the chemistry parameters files provided
                 for Mechs 1 & 2.  PM chemistry has not been
                 tested with either mechanism.  Probing tools
                 are not available with Mech 1.  OSAT and DDM
                 are available for Mech 2, but not PA.


v5.41 Modifications
-------------------

1. Added temperature and pressure adjustments to certain
   photolysis rates.

   Implications: Photolysis rates for NO2, O3, HCHO and
                 CH3CHO are now adjusted for tmeperature
                 and pressure.  Expect maximum impacts
                 to surface ozone to remain within tenths
                 of 1 ppb.  Larger impacts will tend to be
                 seen over high terrain.

2. Ozone dry deposition velocity over oceans is modified
   to be a function of temperature and wind speed.

   Implications: New deposition rates are set according to
                 latest field data reported in the literature.
                 Tends to increase deposition velocity for
                 the W89 scheme; lowers over-ocean ozone
                 concentrations by typically a few ppb. Tends
                 to reduce deposition for the Zhang scheme.

3. For gas-only runs, added a minimum default rate constant
   for heterogeneous N2O5 hydrolysis based on IUPAC 2006.  
   IUPAC lowered the recommended gas-phase rate constant for
   N2O5 + H2O => 2 HNO3 from 2.5E-22 to <1E-22 and heterogeneous
   reactions of N2O5 on aerosols are expected to dominate.  If
   CAMx is run without aerosols, no heterogeneous reaction
   rate for N2O5 can be calculated. To prevent N2O5 removal from
   becoming too slow we now set within CAMx a minimum gas-phase
   rate constant for N2O5 + H2O of 2.5E-22 when aerosols are
   not simulated.

   Implications: This change affects only photochemical
                 simulations without aerosols.  "Ozone only"
                 simulations with CB05 and SAPRC99 are
                 unaffected because these mechanisms use an
                 N2O5 + H2O rate constant of 2.5E-22 (or faster).
                 "Ozone only" simulations with CB6 will now
                 have similar N2O5 removal to CB05 and SAPRC99.

4. Reduced minimum thresholds for cloud/rain water and
   cloud temperature.

   Implications: These changes potentially increase the 
                 range of conditions applicable for wet
                 deposition and aqueous chemistry, leading
                 to more grid cells receiving these
                 treatments.
                 USE WITH UPDATED MM5CAMx AND WRFCAMx TO
                 REALIZE FULL IMPACT FROM INCREASING WET
                 DEPOSITION RATES.

5. Added a capability for the user to specify point source
   plume depth in the input point source file to override
   the internal plume rise calculation.

   Implications: You can set the plume bottom and top for any
                 point source to span multiple CAMx layers.  
                 To invoke this option for a given point source,
                 set its stack height (hstk) and plume rise
                 override (plmht) variables both to negative
                 values.  The absolute values will be used for plume
                 bottom and top, respectively.  The internal
                 plume rise algorithm will be bypassed.  See the
                 description of the point source file in the
                 CAMx User's Guide to see where these variables
                 are carried in the file.  THIS CAPABILITY IS NOT
                 ALLOWED FOR PIG SOURCES.

6. Timing tracers in the source apportionment tool (OSAT) have
   been disabled.

   Implicaitons: This feature will be removed in future releases.


v5.41 Bug Fixes
---------------

1. Fixed two flexi-nesting bugs:

   a) An array indexing bug resulted in faulty interpolation
      of emissions to the target grid;
   b) Lack of interpolation of cloud optical depth caused
      zero cloud impact on photolysis on the target grid.

   Implications: Potentially large differences in most species,
                 improved agreement between flexi-nested and
                 explicit nesting results.

2. Fixed a bug in aerosol photolysis adjustment in the in-line
   TUV option.

   Implications: An array indexing bug resulted in overstating
                 PM column burden and aerosol optical depth.
                 This change may lead to much higher photolysis
                 rates, impacting ozone and PM.

3. Fixed interpolation of OSAT/PSAT tracers from grid to user-
   defined receptors.

   Implications: In prior versions, the interpolation resulted
                 in up to a full grid cell error in the location
                 of the receptor.  In areas with flat OSAT/PSAT
                 tracer gradients, there will be insignificant
                 impacts; expect larger differences in areas
                 with large tracer gradients.

4. The variable containing TERPwOx rates for Process Analysis
   was added to CB05 chemistry.

   Implications: This variable was erroneously absent from the
                 CB05 code.

5. Updated molecular weight definitions for OSAT CB6 tracer
   species.

   Implications: Modifies calculation of average reactivity by
                 source group for OSAT.  Possible differences
                 in distribution of O3N to O3V for mechanism 7
                 source apportionment.

6. The SAPRC99 definition of OSAT VOC species was reinstated.

   Implications: The list of OSAT VOC species for SAPRC99 were
                 erroneously removed in v5.40, leading to O3V
                 tracers being calculated as lower bound.

7. Fixed several bugs related to MPI:

   a) Modified CAMx MPI C libary (parlib) to better handle
      64-bit compilers.

      Implications: Using some 64-bit compilers, the MPI
                    library failed to execute, causing the
                    model to crash.

   b) Reinstated an include file that was missing from the MPI
      pass routine for PiG sampling grids.

      Implications: This bug caused CAMx to crash when using
                    sampling grids with MPI.

   c) The vertical height grid array in the PiG virtual dumping
      algorithm was improperly dimensioned when MPI was invoked.

      Implications: This bug caused large differences in output
                    concentration fields between MPI and non-MPI
                    applications when PiG was used with the
                    LVISPIG virtual dumping flag.

   e) Fixed the meteorological update of DDM boundary condition
      sensitivities on the master grid when running MPI.

      Implications: Previously DDM sensitivities were being
                    adjusted on all boundaries of the MPI slice,
                    now only makes adjustments on the physical
                    master grid boundary. Potentially slightly
                    different DDM results along MPI slice
                    boundaries.

   f) Corrected reporting of PiG grid cell index for chemisty
      error messages.

      Implications: This bug did not properly account for
                    MPI slice offsets when reporting the grid
                    cell in a PiG chemistry crash.

   g) Fixed MPI pass of certain RTCMC variables that have
      been overlooked.

      Implications: Alleviates a program crash when running
                    RTCMC with MPI parallelization.

   i) Fixed bug related to WALL OF CELLS receptors with MPI
      invoked.

      Implications: Using MPI, WALL OF CELLS receptors would
                    report zero concentrations.

   j) Fixed bug related to RTRAC receptors with MPI invoked.

      Implications: Using MPI, RTRAC receptors were not
                    calculated correctly.
      
   k) Fixed bug when reporting list of PiG puffs in the DIAG
      file with MPI invoked.

      Implications: DIAG file was reporting only puffs in
                    one slice.


Overview of Version 5.40
------------------------

V5.40 includes several updates, modifications and bug fixes
from the previous release (v5.30).  The new capabilities
in CAMx include the next version of the Carbon Bond gas-phase
photochemical mechanism (CB6) and an option to treat PM
attenuation of clear-sky photolysis rates.

* New chemistry parameters files are provided to support CB6.
* Use the chemistry parameters files specifically labeled for
  v5.40.  Default light extinction parameters are now set for
  all aerosol species and deposition parameters for many gas
  species have been updated.
* There are no changes to other input file formats from versions
  4.3 through 5.3.
* There are no changes to core model output file formats from
  versions 4.4 through 5.3.
* There are no changes to Probing Tool outputs since version 5.1.

Since v5.0, CAMx is capable of distributed multi-processing
using MPI.  To use MPI you must have the MPICH or MPICH2 utility
installed on your system.  We strongly recommend using MPICH2.
Guidance for running MPI and OMP parallelization is provided in
the README file located in the source code directory, and in the
CAMx User's Guide.


v5.40 Updates
-------------

1. Version 6 of the Carbon Bond photochemical mechanism (CB6)
   is now available.  All CB4 variants have been removed.  The
   current gas-phase mechanisms include CB05, CB6, and SAPRC99,
   and all support CF and CMU PM chemistry and Process Analysis.

   Implications: CB6 extensively revises CB05 with the core
                 inorganic chemistry updated to 2010 and major
                 revisions to the chemistry for aromatics,
                 isoprene, alkenes, alkanes and oxygenates.
                 Several long-lived and abundant VOCs are added
                 explicitly and could be added to emission
                 inventories. Several alpha-dicarbonyls are
                 included because they are SOA precursors.
                 Compared to CB05, more rapid ozone formation is
                 expected for VOC sensitive conditions with less
                 change in ozone for NOx-limited conditions.
                 CB6 has greater computational requirements
                 than CB05.  CB6 can be used with CB05 format
                 emission inventories.

2. The in-line TUV adjustment of clear-sky photolysis rates was
   expanded to account for the effects of simulated PM concentrations
   as the model runs.  This update includes an improved way to
   define the PM model to use in concert with gas-phase chemistry:
   aerosol options are NONE, INERT, CF, and CMU.

   Implications: Aerosol optical properties are defined in the
                 chemistry parameters file and passed to the
                 in-line TUV algorithm.  The albedo/haze/ozone
                 and clear-sky photolysis input files must be
                 generated with the first haze bin set to zero
                 opacity to avoid double-counting of haze effects.
                 Arbitrarily named inert PM species with user-
                 defined size bins can be specified in the
                 chemistry parameters file.  See the CAMx
                 User's Guide for more details.


v5.40 Modifications
-------------------

1. Improved MPI efficiency by reducing the amount of data passed
   back to the master node each hour.

   Implications: MPI applications are faster with improved
                 scalability to higher numbers of CPUs, especially
                 for large applications (large/many grids, Probing
                 Tools).

2. Two internal and transparent structural modifications:
   a) Dimensions and MPI passing of "height" and "depth" arrays
   are handled similarly as all other met variables;
   b) Radicals and 'state' species concentrations are combined
   into a single vector.

   Implications: No changes in model speed or to output
                 concentrations relative to v5.30.

3. PiG puff growth rates were modified to ignore growth
   contributions from horizontal and vertical shear during
   stable/nighttime conditions.  Shear effects remain during
   neutral/unstable/daytime conditions.  Reduced minimum
   limits on vertical diffusivity, turbulent flux moment, and
   nighttime PBL depth.

   Implications: These changes stem from comparing observed
                 nocturnal plume dimensions against PiG.  PiG
                 puff behavior will change potentially
                 significantly at night and above the boundary
                 layer, usually leading to longer lifetimes
                 before dumping to the grid.

v5.30 Bug Fixes
---------------

1. Improved the vertical advection of source apportionment tracers.

   Implications: The source apportionment vertical advection
                 routine was found to cause small spurious
                 tracer concentration increments that could grow
                 in time.  Negligible to minor impacts in source
                 apportionment results (OSAT and PSAT) should be
                 expected.

2. The internal dimensioning of landuse arrays was improved to be
    more robust.

   Implications: This fix alleviates a model crash when dry
                 deposition is turned off. In such cases the
                 number of landuse categories was not set and
                 prohibited dynamic allocation of certain
                 variables.

3. Fixed a bug in domain decomposition for MPI with 2 or more
   nests of the same generation.

   Implications:  Domain decomposition is now performed correctly
                  and alleviates possible model crashes. The nested
                  boundary conditions are now inherited from the
                  correct grid.

4. Fixed a bug that prohibited nested grids from inheriting the source
   area map from the parent when running DDM.

   Implications: If a DDM run included a nest but only a source area map
                 for the parent was provided, all of the cells in the
                 nest would be assigned to region 0. This would effectively
                 eliminate them from the DDM calculations. This has been
                 fixed.
                  
5. Changed the meteorological update of boundary conditions for
   OSAT/DDM (used to convert from mixing ratio to density) to only
   apply at true grid boundaries, not MPI slice boundaries.

   Implications: Insignificant impact on output tracer/DDM fields
                 at the seam of the MPI slices. 

6. Code that handles seasonal LAI adjustments in routine SRFRUF
   was simplified to be consistent with routine DRYDEP.

   Implications: No impact on output concentrations or deposition.

7. A flag was added to explicitly turn off chemistry in PiG
   when the user-defined Mechanism 10 is run.

   Implications: This change ensures that no chemistry is run
                 in PiG with Mech 10 invoked.

8. Fixed a bug that caused an error when reading the boundary
   condition file for source apportionment when timestamp crossed
   over the new year.

   Implications: Now adjusts date/time properly for crossing over a
                 new year.

9. Fixed a bug in several file-writing routines that caused an
   improper date stamp on concentration and deposition output
   files at midnight of a new year.

   Implications: No impact for most users, except now post-
                 processors and boundary extraction programs
                 will work more correctly when crossing over
                 a new year.
