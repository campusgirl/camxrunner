A PSAT macro has been developed to expedite postprocessing when
running CAMx with PSAT.  The software uses the CAMx output *.receptor files and 
consists of two parts:
  psat_combine.f and 
  psat_macro.2008.xls.

________________________________________________________________________________
psat_combine.f reads in a CAMx PSAT receptor file(s) and outputs a new file of 
similar format containing the 24-hour average of the desired date. 

Main options built into this program:
   1.  Option to shift the time stamp to adjust to local time
   2.  Ability to read in one or more receptor files with consecutive time 
       periods to get the 24hr average.
   3.  Ability to merge species from different files with the same time and 
       receptors (in case the PSAT run is split into separate runs)

# DESCRIPTION OF JOB INPUTS
# line 1: output receptor file
# line 2: Number of hours to shift the time stamp
# line 3: Julian date to extract
# line 4: True/False: if the inputs do not include all 24 hours, should a 
#         non-24hour average be output?
# line 5: Number of input receptor files with different (but consecutive) 
#         time stamps
# line 6: Number of input receptor files with different species groups 
#         (but same time period and receptors)
# line 7: Input receptor file (time period 1, species group 1)
# line 8+ (optional) List all other input receptor files from time period 1,
#         then repeat for time period 2 
#         USER MUST INPUT THE SPECIES GROUP(S) IN THE SAME ORDER

The second step is to run the psat_macro.xls
This macro reads the receptor file generated from psat_combine.f and outputs
an excel file that creates:

1.  bar charts showing the 24-hr contribution of each species from each
    source region and emission group.  
    Gases are placed in the "barchart_gas" sheet.
    Particulates are placed in the "barchart_pm" sheet
2.  a ranking of the top contributors of each species
3.  pie charts of species contributions to PM2.5 and PM-10 if all species 
    are available.
    See the "piecharts" sheet, if applicable.


To run the macro:

1: Push the "Browse for Input" button to locate the receptor file
        This will fill in the directory path and input file name in cells C1 
        and C2, respectively.  It will also fill in cell C7 with the date.

2: modify options.
        Cell C3: use the drop down menu to select the receptor
        Cell C4: Set the max number of contributors to be listed for ranking
        Cell C5: TRUE/FALSE: include user-defined labels to the source
             regions and emission groups?
             If TRUE, define source regions starting in cell B17 
             (for region 1), cell B18 for region 2, and so forth. 
             Similarly, define emission groups starting in cell C17.
             if FALSE, source regions and emission groups will be labeled 1,2,3.
        Cell C6: CAMx run name
        Cell C11: output file name.  This concatenates many options above
             (run name, receptor, date).

3: Push the "Run PSAT Macro" button.
