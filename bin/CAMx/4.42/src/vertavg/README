VERTAVG Program (9/20/06)
-------------------------

The program reads in a CAMx 3D average file (*.avrg, *.favrg, *.cpa)
and vertically averages grid cell values for each species on file
over the mixing layer for each hour on file.  The mixing layer is 
determined by the input CAMx Kv file.  Density weighting is performed.
The output file as in the binary coarse grid average format.

Build the executable using the available "makefile".  Just type "make"
at the prompt on a machine with a Fortran compiler, and in the directory
where your fortran source code exists.  Note that the makefile provided
is written for Portland Group's F77 compiler.  If you don't have PGF77,
then need to change the "pgf77" commmand to your specific compiler.

Two job scripts are provided as samples (one for standard CAMx output
files, another for CPA output files).

The job script is pretty self-explanatory:
line 1: domain to extract (COARSE or FINE #)
line 2: CAMx vertical diffusivity file for the domain to be extracted
line 3: CAMx height/pressure file
line 4: CAMx temperature file
line 5: Coarse grid average or CPA file
line 6: Fine grid average or CPA file -- skip this line for a coarse
        grid extraction
line 7: Output file (formatted as a coarse grid average file)
