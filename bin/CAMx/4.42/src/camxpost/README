CAMx POST PROCESSING UTILITIES
------------------------------

This directory contains a number of post processing utilities for CAMx,
mainly for the purposes of statistical and graphical model performance
evaluation.  This README file contains some information on how to run
the various programs and describes their I/O.  The order in which the
programs are described are generally the order in which they are run.

The following programs are described here:
AVGCAT
OBSCAT
CAMXPOST
CAMXSTAT
EXTSTAT
COMBINE2
TIME_SERIES.XLS

------------------------
UPDATE 1 OCTOBER 2009
------------------------

CAMXSTAT has been updated to fix an unitialized variable error when
no input observations exceed the user-specified minimum.  Also adds
additional array size checking for number of sites, hours and species
to alleviate segmenation violations.

EXSTAT has been updated:
- Two new statistics are extracted:
  - daily max observed
  - paired (in space) predicted max 
- Output contains more labels
- The job script requires an extra line of input to specify
  the name of the run (up to 10 characters) is needed

AVGCAT
-----

AVGCAT concatenates several CAMx AVERAGE files together into a single file.
The program only operates on COARSE GRID AVERAGE formatted files (i.e., those 
with a format similar to UAM).  It will not read the FINE GRID AVERAGE files 
directly output by CAMx.  Therefore, if data from a fine grid is to be 
processed by AVGCAT, then the CAMxTRCT postprocessing utility needs to be 
run on the CAMx fine grid output to generate files with the coarse grid format.
AVGCAT assumes that all files to be concatenated contain the same grid 
configuration, and the same number and order of chemical species.

Generally, CAMx is run for individual days of a multi-day simulation episode.
The main purpose for AVGCAT is to provide continuous hourly model output data 
in a single file to simplify the process of calculating running n-hour averages
(e.g., 8, 24, etc.) over multi-day simulations.  The output of AVGCAT 
could also be viewed in PAVE without the need for "chaining" multiple daily 
files.

A sample AVGCAT job script follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns 1-20 of the job script are reserved for input record descriptions;
input data should start in column 21.
-Record 1 contains the pathname of the output file.
-Record 2 contains the number of input files to concatenate.
-Record 3+ contains the pathnames of the input files.


OBSCAT
------

OBSCAT concatenates several OBSERVATION data files together into a single file.
The program only operates on files formatted for the CAMxPOST system of
post processors.  OBSCAT assumes that all input OBSERVATION files contain 
identical numbers of hour records (e.g., 24 hours per site) and identical 
lists of monitoring sites.

Generally, separate OBSERVATION files are developed for the CAMx post 
processing system for each day of a multi-day simulation episode.  However, 
the system will also work for a single OBSERVATION file convering the entire 
episode.  The main purpose for OBSCAT is to provide continuous hourly 
measurement data in a single file to simplify the process of calculating 
running n-hour averages (e.g., 8, 24, etc.) over multi-day simulations.  The 
output of OBSCAT could also be used for all subsequent operations of the CAMx
post processing system. 

A sample OBSCAT job script follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh
obscat << EOF

                   |o3.obs.aug22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns 1-20 of the job script are reserved for input record descriptions;
input data should start in column 21.
-Record 1 contains the pathname of the output file.
-Record 2 contains a new message to be placed at the top of the
 output file (each daily file can contain a unique message).
-Record 3 contains the number of input files to concatenate.
-Record 4+ contains the pathnames of the input files.


CAMxPOST
--------

CAMxPOST is the central program in the CAMx post processing system to prepare 
files for statistical evaluation and/or to generate 8- or 24-hour mean
predicted concentration fields.  The program provides the following 
capabilities:

 1) Generates a running n-hourly file in COARSE GRID AVERAGE format
 2) Generates a maximum n-hourly file in COARSE GRID AVERAGE format
 3) Pairs predictions and observations and generates an ASCII running n-hourly 
    prediction-observation file for further processing of stats and plotting
    of time-series (also provides the minimum and maximum predicted 
    concentrations within a nine-cell area around each monitoring location)
 4) Generates an ASCII file of maximum observations at each site

where "n-hourly" refers to averages over 1 to serveral hours (e.g., 8, 24, 
etc.)  

The program only operates on COARSE GRID AVERAGE formatted files 
(i.e., those with a format similar to UAM).  It will not read the FINE GRID 
AVERAGE files directly output by CAMx.  Therefore, if data from a fine grid is 
to be processed by CAMxPOST, then the CAMxTRCT postprocessing utility needs to 
be run on the CAMx fine grid output to generate files with the coarse grid 
format.  If, for example, running 8-hourly average concentrations are 
requested for a particular day, then the COARSE GRID AVERAGE FILE supplied
to the program must contain 1-hour data into the following day so that an
entire set of 24 8-hourly means can be calculated (thus AVGCAT would need
to be run prior to running CAMxPOST). This would not be necessary if 1-hour
concentrations are requested.

CAMxPOST processes only the surface layer (layer 1) from the input file, and
operates on only one chemical species.  All of the capabilities listed above
are optional, and are selected by supplying a valid output file name in the
job script.  For example, if the input OBSERVATION file name is blank, 
all processing related to observation-prediction pairing will not be performed.
If the gridded output file names are not supplied, they will not be generated.


A sample CAMxPOST job script that generates a 1-hourly ASCII 
prediction-observation (PREDOBS) file for a single day follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh

 (in this case 24 1-hourly averages will be processed, starting from hour 0, 
 Julian day 227, 1998 to hour 23, Julian day 227, 1998).
-Record 9 contains the species to process, using the naming convention in the
 CAMx chemistry parameters file or a name generated using CAMxTRCT 
 (in this case ozone).
-Record 10 contains the distance (km) from the monitoring site containing 
 the peak n-hourly concentration to search for the peak n-hourly prediction;
 this value is ignored if observation-prediction processing is not performed
 (in this case a peak prediction will be found within 50 km of the peak site).
-Record 11 contains the sub-domain (grid cell indices), in I1,I2,J1,J2 format,
 to search for the peak n-hourly prediction; this value is ignored if 
 observation-prediction processing is not performed; a value of (0  0  0  0) 
 indicates that the entire input grid is to be searched; the more restrictive

 (in this case 50 km is more restricive).
-Record 12 contains a new message to be placed into the PREDOBS file.

CAMXSTAT
--------

CAMxSTAT reads an n-hourly PREDOBS file generated by CAMxPOST and calculates
the following statistics:

 1) Unpaired (time and space) peak prediction accuracy
 2) Space-paired, time-unpaired peak prediction accuracy by site
 3) Space-paired, time-unpaired peak bias and error over all sites
 4) Space-paired, time-unpaired bias and error in peak timing
 5) Space-paired, time-paired peak bias and error over all sites
 6) Mean prediction
 7) Mean observation
 8) Difference and normalized difference in mean pred and mean obs
 9) Absolute, normalized, and fractional bias
10) Absolute, normalized, and fractional error
11) Root mean square error

These statistics are written to an ASCII report file.  CAMxSTAT operates on the
entire contents of the input PREDOBS file, whether it spans a single day or 
several, whether 1-hourly or some other averaging period.  Therefore, the user 
should ensure that the PREDOBS file supplied reflects the desired period and 
n-hourly averaging.

Statistics generated under items (2)-(5) and (9)-(11) are calculated only for 
prediction-observation pairings in which the observation is above some lower
threshold.  For example, 1-hour ozone statistics are usually calculated for 
observations above 60 ppb, while 8-hour CO statistics are calculated for
observations above 5 ppm.

A sample CAMxSTAT job script that generates 1-hourly statistics for a single 
day follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh
camxstat << EOF
Input PRED/OBS data|predobs.980815.base.o3.1hourly

Units              |ppb
EOF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns 1-20 of the job script are reserved for input record descriptions;
input data should start in column 21.
-Record 1 contains the pathname of the input PREDOBS file.
-Record 2 contains the pathname of the output ASCII statistics report file.
-Record 3 contains the minimum threshold concentration for valid prediction-
 observation pairings (in this case it is 60 ppb).
-Record 4 is a factor by which to scale all predictions (in this case, no
 scaling is done).
-Record 5 provides the concentration units for the report file.


EXTSTAT
-------

EXTSTAT is a small program that pulls important statistics from a series of
report files generated by CAMxSTAT so that they may be more easily mported
into a spreadsheet for producing graphical summaries.  The statistics that
are pulled are:

 1) Unpaired peak prediction accuracy
 2) bias in paired peak accuracy among all valid sites
 2) error in paired peak accuracy among all valid sites
 4) bias in peak timing
 5) overall normalized bias
 6) overall normalized error

A sample EXTSTAT job script that pulls 1-hourly statistics from several 
statistical report files follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh
extstat << EOF
Output file        |stats.base.o3.1hourly
# of files         |8

                   |stats.980817.base.o3.1hourly
                   |stats.980818.base.o3.1hourly
                   |stats.980819.base.o3.1hourly
                   |stats.980820.base.o3.1hourly
                   |stats.980821.base.o3.1hourly
                   |stats.980822.base.o3.1hourly
EOF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns 1-20 of the job script are reserved for input record descriptions;
input data should start in column 21.
-Record 1 contains the pathname of the output ASCII file that can be imported 
 into a spreadsheet.
-Record 2 provies the number of input files to process.
-Record 3+ provies the pathname of the input statistics report files.

After running EXTSTAT, copy and paste the outputs into Excel
(2 samples are provided for convenience) to generate daily bar chart
statistics.  

Notes:
-The user may have to make changes to compensate for the number of dates in the 
 episode.
-The user must clear -999's, if necessary (due to the lack of observations
 meeting the threshold requirement in camxstat).  


COMBINE2
--------

COMBINE2 prepares data contained in PREDOBS files for plotting with the 
TIME_SERIES.XLS spreadsheet macro.  The key process of COMBINE2 is really just
to reformat the PREDOBS files into comma-delimited records to ease the parsing
of data as it is read by the Excel macro. However, COMBINE2 performs some other
important functions, including:

 1) Concatenates individual PREDOBS files (e.g., daily) into a single file
 2) Combines PREDOBS data from up to 3 different model runs into a single file,
    ordered into separate columns
 3) Allows the user to split the resulting output file into multiple files
    each containing a sub-set of monitoring sites (this is necessary since 
    Excel graphics are memory-intensive, and memory limits are easily 
    exceeded for PREDOBS files with many sites (~50) over many days (~10))
    
This program assumes that all input PREDOBS files contain an identical number
of hour records and an identical list of stations. Since CAMxPOST generates
PREDOBS files containing only one chemical species, COMBINE2 must see that the
same species is on all PREDOBS files to be combined.

A sample COMBINE2 job script that would typically be used to prepare a
multi-day 1-hourly PREDOBS file for time-series plotting follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/csh

TIME_SERIES.XLS
---------------

TIME_SERIES.XLS is an Excel macro that generates time-series and scatter plots
of data prepared by COMBINE2.  Upon opening this file in Excel, the macro
automatically starts and prompts the user in a dialogue box to select 
time-series and/or scatter plots.  Once the selection is made, the macro
continues and prompts the user to supply the name of the macro-ready PREDOBS
file on which to operate.  When the file is selected, the macro continues and
reads the file, parses the data, and begins to plot the data (on some machines
it will appear that the macro is doing nothing -- wait until the next dialogue
box prompt appears).  The macro will then prompt the user to specify the
number of plots per page, and the y-axis scale to apply to all time-series
plots.  When completed, the plots will be organized by worksheet.  The user
must manually save this file as an Excel spreadsheet to save the graphics.

NOTE: this macro tends to crash on PCs that do not have a specific printer
driver installed.  The graphics and page setup depend upon knowing the 
characteristics of the attached printer driver.
