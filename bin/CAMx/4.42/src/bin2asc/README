BIN2ASC and ASC2BIN conversion programs (9/14/06)
-------------------------------------------------

The BIN2ASC program provides a simple way to convert
CAMx Fortran binary gridded output files (UAM format)
to a formatted ASCII text format.  The ASC2BIN program
converts the opposite direction.  The program code
can also serve as a reference to the binary read/write
formats and orders of all the variables on file.

Usage is simple:
1) Compile the single fortran file of the program you
   wish to use using the "f77" script provided (NOTE:
   you may need to change the "pgf77" compiler command
   to your specific compiler);
   Just type "f77 bin2asc.f" at the prompt on a computer
   that has a fortran compiler in the directory where
   the source code resides.
2) Run the program at a shell prompt.
3) Follow the instructions on the screen to enter
   input/output file paths/names.

The program automatically determines the type of
file according to the file keyword that is written
as the first variable on file.  The program is
F77, so you may need to increase the dimension parameters
if the program warns you of a problem.  Simply edit
the values of dimension parameters and re-compile.
