Compile AHOMAP using the makefile included under the src/ directory.
Compiler and associated flag variables are supplied for PGF and Intel.

The example job script runs AHOMP in two modes: for daily input TOMS files,
and for a monthly input TOMS file.  Both test problems are for a non-nested 
application.  For a nested application you may list a landuse file for each 
grid in the job script. The resulting AHO file will include albedo panels for
each landuse file you provide.  

*NOTE: The AHOMAP program will only generate the mandatory AHO inputs to CAMx,
       which include UV albedo, haze turbidity, and ozone column.  It will not 
       generate optional input fields now supported by CAMx, which include snow
       cover, surface roughness, land-ocean mask, and drought stress (See CAMx
       User's Guide for more information). It is left to the user to generate
       the optional input fields and appropriately include them into the AHO
       file.

Revsion History
---------------
Feb 2008:
1. AHOMAP.F and TOMSPREP.F have been generalized to automatically handle older
   TOMS files (on 1.25 x 1.00 degree grid) and the latest OMI TOMS files (on
   1.00 x 1.00 degree grid).

May 2006:
1. Updated to fix a minor bug and to improve the makefile.

Oct 2005:
1. Updated the routine UTMGEO.F in order to properly handle UTM grids in
   southern hemisphere latitudes.  This routine is now consistent with the 
   version available with CAMx.  The UTM zone number in the southern hemisphere
   should be set to a negative value.

Sep 2005:
1. Fixed a bug in the coordinate definition section. It now recongnizes
   'LAMBERT' as the keyword for the LAMBERT coordinate system, and will stop
   if the keyword does not match UTM, LATLON, LAMBERT, or POLAR.  Previously,
   a misspelled keyword was not trapped, leading to incorrect calculation
   of location for the determinination of ozone column.

May 2005: 
1. Added a user option to account for snow cover in the definition of the 5
   albedo ranges. If this is invoked, the fifth albedo bin will be reserved for
   snow and be set to the default value of 0.5; the remaining 4 bins will be
   used to represent the albedo ranges from the landuse file.  If this is not
   invoked, all 5 albedo bins will be used to represent albedo ranges from the
   landuse file.
2. TOMSprep has been removed as an option from the job script; TOMSprep is
   now run automatically to fill holes in daily TOMS fields.
3. Fixed a divide-by-zero bug in the case when a single ozone or albedo
   value is used for an entire domain.
4. Removed old leftover code that filled missing ozone data prior to TOMSprep.

January 2005:
1. The TOMSprep option was added, which helps to fill holes in the daily
   TOMS fields that can occur at low latitudes.
2. The capability to use monthly TOMS files was added.

December 2001:
1. A bug related to fine grid index was fixed.

January 2001:
1. The ahomap.f program was revised to output dates in Julian format (YYDDD) 
   rather than calendar (YYMMDD).
